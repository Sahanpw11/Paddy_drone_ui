# Sri Lankan Paddy Field Detection drone UI

This repository contains the user interface (UI) for a software tool designed specifically for the detection of paddy fields in Sri Lanka from drones. Please note that this UI is a prototype and does not have functional capabilities. Its purpose is to showcase the design and layout of the interface.

## Overview

The software is intended to aid farmers in Sri Lanka in identifying paddy fields within their agricultural plots by drones. Sri Lankan paddy fields tend to be relatively small in size, and within these fields, farmers may cultivate other crops alongside paddy. Additionally, there may be various other elements present such as trees, roads, water bodies, etc.

The primary objective of this software is to accurately detect the areas within these fields where paddy cultivation is present. This information can then be utilized for targeted fertilizer application using drones, optimizing resource allocation, and increasing agricultural productivity.

## Folder Structure

The UI is organized into separate folders, each representing different pages or components of the interface. Here's a brief overview of the folder structure:

- `controller`: Contains files related to the home page of the UI.
- `overview`: Includes files for displaying the paddy field detection results and realtime view and other details.
- `map view`: Contains files related to map view and how the gps system works.
- `manual`: Contains details about how to control the drone manualy.

## Usage

As mentioned earlier, this UI is a non-functional prototype and does not perform any actual detection or analysis. It serves as a visual representation of how the interface might look and function in a real application.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the UI design or add functionality are welcome. If you're interested in contributing, please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
